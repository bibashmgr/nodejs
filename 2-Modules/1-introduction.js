// Modules
// Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.
// A set of functions you want to include in your application.

// Built-in Modules
// Node.js has a set of built-in modules which you can use without any further installation.
// to include a module, you need to use require(filepath) function
// For example:
// 1. path - To handle file paths
// 2. os - Provides information about the operation system
// 3. fs - To handle the file system
// 4. http/https - To make Node.js act as an HTTP/HTTPs server
// 5. url - To parse URL strings

// Custom Modules
// You can create your own modules, and easily include them in your applications.
// Notice that we use ./ to locate the module
